# About Redux
` Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer.
` Redux is a framework used on the frontend of a web application.
` It basically carries a payload of information from the application      to the store.
` It takes a "previous result" (the state ), and the "current item" (the action object), decides a new state value based on those arguments, and returns that new state
